                    At a distance of 15 km from Panjim Kadamba Bus Stand, 4 km from Candolim and 49 km from Margao Railway Station, the grand Fort of Aguada was constructed to prevent the entry of ships into the River Mandovi thus protecting old Goa from the attacks of Dutch and Marathas. Aguda Fort is one of the prime Goa tourist places and one of the major heritage sites in Goa state. Aguada Fort is one of the top attractions you must include in Goa packages.
                    <br>
                    The Aguada Fort was built by the Portuguese colonial rulers on the beach south of Candolim at the shore of the Mandovi River in 1612. A freshwater spring within the fort provided water supply to the ships that used to stop by. This is how the fort got its name 'Aguada' meaning Water. The heart of the fort was protected by two hundred cannons and a deep dry moat, which one still has to cross to get inside.

                    Shri Mangeshi temple is located on a hillock at Mangeshi Village in Priol, Ponda Taluka. Shri Mangeshi Temple is one of the largest, wealthiest and most popular Hindu shrines in Goa. Mythology says that Lord Shiva came to Goa after having lost everything in a game of dice against his wife Parvati. When Parvati came looking for him, he disguised himself as a tiger and frightened her. In a state of shock, Parvati uttered the words ''Trahi Mam Grisha'', which means ''O Lord of the Mountains, save me''. Shiva then reverted into his normal form and returned with her. The words, ''Mam Grisha'' came to be associated with this story and Shiva came to be known as 'Manguesh'. The place where this tale occurred was marked by building a temple at the site. This location is to the south of the Zuari River where the present day village of Cortalim stands.
                    <br>
                    When Salcete was captured by the Portuguese in 1543, the devotees shifted the deity from Cortalim to a nearby village that came to be known as Mangeshi. The temple which is believed to be built around 1744 has been rebuilt and has undergone several renovations. It was built with income from land donated by a local ruler under the Marathas.
